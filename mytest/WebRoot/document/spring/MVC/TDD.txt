TDD 一种开发方式

Before we implement the methods in SimpleProductManager, we're going to define some tests first. The
strictest definition of Test Driven Development (TDD) is to always write the tests first, then the code. A
looser interpretation of it is more akin to Test Oriented Development (TOD), where we alternate between
writing code and tests as part of the development process. The most important thing is for a codebase to have as
complete a set of unit tests as possible, so how you achieve it becomes somewhat academic. Most TDD
developers, however, do agree that the quality of tests is always higher when they are written at around the
same time as the code that is being developed, so that's the approach we're going to take.
